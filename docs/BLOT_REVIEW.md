# Reviewing Blots

This document describes how to review a Blot submission.
It corresponds to the this file on [how to submit a Blot submission](https://github.com/hackclub/blot/blob/main/docs/GET_A_BLOT.md).

# Submission Criteria

The primary question to have in mind as a reviewer is "Did this person apply earnest effort in pushing themselves to learn something new?"

The general criteria is that the art piece is 

- original
- beautiful/interesting to look at
- algorithmic is some way

The first point is somewhat obvious though still can take some effort to check. 
Verify that the code was not copied from the gallery or somewhere like Turtle Toy.
Also try to evaluate if the user overly relied on ChatGPT or some other LLM. 
It's acceptable to use these tools but the piece should be more involved than simply asking a single prompt and copying what comes out.
If you are on the fence as to whether the program was ai-generated ask the submitter to make some specific changes.
Try to specify tasks which may not be easily prompt-able (it's a moving target what these might be). 
For example if they drew a bunch of straight lines as blades of grass ask them to give the grass some thickness and bends. 

The second point about making something beautiful is subjective but can be satisfied at a variety of skill levels.
This is also trying to encourage submitters to not just copy algorithms or generic visualizations. 
By encouraging people to incorporate aesthetics and composition we also encourage them to incorporate more of their individuality and thought.

This last point on being algorithmic is to prevent simply specifiying points in curves manually.
To check if something is algorithmic look for the use of functions and variables.
This point is clearly satisfied if there is a variable clearly specified that can be adjusted to change a drawing or if drawings are automatically varied through randomness.
A piece may not be random on each generation if parameterization is provided through hardcoded variables or if the random seed is set.
