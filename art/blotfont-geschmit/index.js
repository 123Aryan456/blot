/**
* BlotFont - A demo of the BlotFont library
* This is a demo of my BlotFont library I wrote for the Hack Club Blot, which
* makes drawing text easy to do.
*
* THIS IS A BUILT SOURCE! It's advised you look at the original repository
* where this code came from. 
* You can find it here: https://github.com/geschmit/blotfont
*
* You can still play around with this, though :3
