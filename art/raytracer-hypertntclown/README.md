# Raytracer

This is a fairly limited raytracer, currently only able to render spheres, I built based on concepts learned from [Computer Graphics from Scratch](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/). I highly recommend anyone who's interested in building their own raytracer to check this out.

It has two "modes". Mainly there is the one adapted to use a post processing filter inspired by [Ruben Stenlund's SineArt](https://blot.hackclub.com/editor?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackclub/blot/main/art/SineArt-Ruben/index.js), as otherwise it would for sure not have been able to be drawn by a Blot.

The second "mode", activated by changing a boolean at the top of the script, shows the raytraced result before being filtered.
